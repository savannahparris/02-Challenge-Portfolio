# 02-Challenge-Portfolio
In this project I will create a portfolio to showcase my work to future employers. I will also include a professional heashot image of me, a brief discription of my work expeience and my contact information. This portfolio will start out utilizing only HTML and CSS, however as I progress in this program I will add other coding languages to increase the functionality and appearance of my portfolio.
